Ingredients
4 chicken thighs (about 1 1/2 pounds), excess skin trimmed
Kosher salt
Freshly ground black pepper
1 tablespoon olive oil
3 garlic cloves, chopped

Method
To make the cola braised chicken, start by seasoning chicken thighs on both sides with salt and pepper. Let sit at room while you prepare the sauce. Also, preheat an oven to 325°F.

Over medium heat, warm olive oil in a medium saucepan that can also go in the oven. Add garlic and cook, stirring occasionally, until the edges start turning golden brown (about 2 minutes). 
Stir in the fire roasted tomatoes, cola, chipotle chiles and 1 1/2 teaspoons salt.

Bring mixture to a boil, take off the heat, then add chicken in an even layer. The liquid won’t completely cover the chicken. Tuck lime slices into the sauce, then braise, uncovered, in the oven until the chicken is cooked through (35 to 40 minutes).

Remove chicken from the sauce, then season sauce to taste with salt. 

Once cool enough to handle, remove skin and pull chicken off the bone into bite-sized pieces. Return chicken to the sauce and let sit for at least 15 minutes before using as a pizza topping (it gets tastier the longer it sits in the sauce). Transfer to the fridge if letting sit longer than 15 minutes. 

You’ll have enough chicken for 2 pizzas.
To make the bbq chicken pizza, preheat an oven to 500°F, and set an oven rack in the lowest possible position. Lightly coat a pizza pan with nonstick cooking spray.
